#C212 Final Project - Trails
##What is Trails?
Trails is a 2 player game played on a board of hexagonal tiles. It can be seen as having a similar complexity as chess or go, but with simple rules and a clear winning state that allows new players to quickly pick up and play with ease. The game offers intricacies that make the game rewarding to master and, combined with the impossibility of a draw-game, gives a satisfying game.

##What is the Project?
You will be given a files that contain only the public methods annotated by javadocs. Do not alter any of the method signatures of private methods, but feel free to add your own private helpers.

##How did I work with my partner?
Excellently. Jared has been a blast. It's interesting how we combined out knowledge and went through problems head on. If he didn't know something, I did it. If I didn't know something, he helped me. So yeah... (Am I doing this right?)


##What did I do in mileStone 5?
I made the randomMoveRule-set. I just changed the NextTurn() to be a random double, with set constraints on it (if it's greater than 0.5, it's red), otherwise it's blue. So then I just changed making a move, so it literally makes a random move.
I was working on Removal moveset but then Eclipse went down. After it went back up, I couldn't get it to work. The class is still there, but eh
